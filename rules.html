        <center>Spokane Cyber Cup Rules
    </h1>
	  <p>
      The main goal of the event is to provide a platform for students to learn and showcase their cybersecurity skills. As such, all rules are designed to support this goal. Although this is a competition, we want to emphasize learning - the real winners are the folks are those who learn the most!
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h2>Team Size</h2>
	
	<p>Maximum team size is five. Teams may have up to two graduate students per team.</p>
	<br/>
	
    <h2>Team Divisions</h2>
    <p>
      There are two divisions for teams: upper division (Swallow) and lower (Canary) division. The purpose of these divisions is to ensure a fair competition by grouping teams with similar skill levels. 
    </p>
	  <p>
      Any team that has a student with previous cybersecurity experience will be listed as an upper division team.
    </p>
    <br/>
    
    <p>
      If a team has no previous cybersecurity experience, the team will be a lower division team.
    </p>
    <br/> 

    <h2>
      Individual Signup
    </h2>
    <p>
      You may sign up as an <i>individual</i>. For those who don't have a group to play with, you can sign up as an individual. If you do this, you'll be placed on a team by the organizers for the event with other individual students.
    </p>
	  <br/>
	
    <h2>
      No LLMs / Automated Scanners
    </h2>
    <p>
	    Please bring a personal computer/laptop of your own. Google and all websites found on the Internet with useful knowledge/information are allowed. Textbooks are allowed. Your brains are allowed!
    </p>

    <p>
      We love LLMs, code assisting tools like Cursor and scanning tools. However, the goal of the event is to learn. Plugging in challenges to an LLM or some tool does not teach you anything. So, we would appreciate if used your brain to solve the challenges :)
